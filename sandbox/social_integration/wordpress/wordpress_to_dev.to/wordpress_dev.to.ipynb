You can manage your profile and also create a company profile for your organization. An interesting feature of LinkedIn is the ability to share posts on your feed or on your organization’s feed. You can embed URLs, provide hashtags and emojis and also share images and videos in your post. Although the primary way of sharing content on LinkedIn is by using the web application, you can also do it programmatically using the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/\">REST APIs</a> provided by LinkedIn and a programming language of your choice.</p>\\n\\n<p>In this article, we are going to learn how to use the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/\">LinkedIn REST APIs</a> and share content from your personal profile as well as from an organization’s profile that you manage. Don’t worry if you do not have an organization as I will guide you from the scratch.</p>\\n\\n<h2>\\n  <a name=\"prerequisites\" href=\"#prerequisites\">\\n  </a>\\n  Pre-requisites\\n</h2>\\n\\n<p>In order to proceed further, we need to have the following pre-requisites.</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<strong>LinkedIn Account</strong> – You need to have a LinkedIn account, if you do not have one, please head over to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">https://www.linkedin.com/</a> and create one.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>REST APIs</strong> – Some basic knowledge of using REST APIs.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>Python</strong> – General programming knowledge of using python and using REST APIs in python.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Apart from the above-mentioned, I am going to use Jupyter notebooks to create the codebase and make it available using GitHub. At any point in time, you can choose to refer to the official documentation of LinkedIn from Microsoft, however, I will try to explain the process in simple terms.</p>\\n\\n<h1>\\n  <a name=\"creating-the-linkedin-company-page-and-application\" href=\"#creating-the-linkedin-company-page-and-application\">\\n  </a>\\n  Creating the LinkedIn Company Page and Application\\n</h1>\\n\\n<p>Assuming that you already have your LinkedIn account created, now we will create the following two assets.</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/linkedin-pages\">LinkedIn Company Page</a> – Also, can be referred to as the Company page, we need to create it using your personal account. You will be an admin for the Company page that you create.</li>\\n<li>\\n<a href=\"https://developer.linkedin.com/\">An Application on the Developers portal</a> – In order to get access to the LinkedIn REST APIs, we need to create an application, that will assume the permissions on our behalf and share content on your profile or from the organisation’s profile.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2>\\n  <a name=\"create-the-linkedin-company-page\" href=\"#create-the-linkedin-company-page\">\\n  </a>\\n  Create the LinkedIn Company Page.\\n</h2>\\n\\n<p>Let’s create a company page from your LinkedIn account.

       " 'body_markdown': '\\n# Introduction\\n\\n\\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is a popular social media platform that allows users to connect to each other and maintain professional network. You can manage your profile and also create a company profile for your organization. An interesting feature of LinkedIn is the ability to share posts on your feed or on your organization’s feed. You can embed URLs, provide hashtags and emojis and also share images and videos in your post. Although the primary way of sharing content on LinkedIn is by using the web application, you can also do it programmatically using the [REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/) provided by LinkedIn and a programming language of your choice.\\n\\n\\nIn this article, we are going to learn how to use the [LinkedIn REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/) and share content from your personal profile as well as from an organization’s profile that you manage. Don’t worry if you do not have an organization as I will guide you from the scratch.\\n\\n\\n## Pre-requisites\\n\\n\\nIn order to proceed further, we need to have the following pre-requisites.\\n\\n\\n1. **LinkedIn Account** – You need to have a LinkedIn account, if you do not have one, please head over to <https://www.linkedin.com/> and create one.\\n2. **REST APIs** – Some basic knowledge of using REST APIs.\\n3. **Python** – General programming knowledge of using python and using REST APIs in python.\\n\\n\\nApart from the above-mentioned, I am going to use Jupyter notebooks to create the codebase and make it available using GitHub. At any point in time, you can choose to refer to the official documentation of LinkedIn from Microsoft, however, I will try to explain the process in simple terms.\\n\\n\\n# Creating the LinkedIn Company Page and Application\\n\\n\\nAssuming that you already have your LinkedIn account created, now we will create the following two assets.\\n\\n\\n1. [LinkedIn Company Page](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/linkedin-pages) – Also, can be referred to as the Company page, we need to create it using your personal account. You will be an admin for the Company page that you create.\\n2. [An Application on the Developers portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) – In order to get access to the LinkedIn REST APIs, we need to create an application, that will assume the permissions on our behalf and share content on your profile or from the organisation’s profile.\\n\\n\\n## Create the LinkedIn Company Page.\\n\\n\\nLet’s create a company page from your LinkedIn account. You can think of any dummy name for your company to proceed forward. I am going to use my company as “*DataScholar*”.\\n\\n\\n***Step 1***: Open LinkedIn account. Click on **Work** and select **Create a Company Page**. Click on **Company** and enter the details and click on **Create Page**.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled.png?resize=1024%2C411&ssl=1)Figure 1 – Create LinkedIn company page\\n***Step 2***: You need to provide the following details for your company page to be created.\\n\\n\\n1. **Name** – The name of your company. I am using *DataScholar*.\\n2. **Company** **URL** – The LinkedIn username of your company.\\n3. **Website** – The website your company is hosted on. I am going to use “*<https://thedatascholar.com>*”.\\n4. **Industry** – Select as *Software*.\\n5. **Company** **Size** – I have selected *between 0 and 1* since I am the sole user of the company.\\n6. **Company** **Type** – *Non-profit*.\\n7. **Logo** – Any custom image for your company logo.\\n8. **Tagline** – A short description of your company.\\n\\n\\nOnce you have provided all these details, your LinkedIn company page has been created now.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-1.png?resize=1024%2C606&ssl=1)Figure 2 – LinkedIn company page\\n## Create the LinkedIn app in the Developer Portal.\\n\\n\\nIn this section, we will dig a bit deeper and create an application on LinkedIn Developer’s platform that will allow us to interact with the LinkedIn assets programmatically.\\n\\n\\n***Step 1***: Navigate to <https://developer.linkedin.com/>. Click on **My Apps** and then select **Create App**. Enter the details for your application.\\n\\n\\n1. **App Name** – The name for your application. You can use the same name as your company.\\n2. **LinkedIn Page** – The company page that the app will be associated with.\\n3. **Privacy Policy URL** – Optional field.\\n4. **App Logo** – Upload a logo for your app.\\n\\n\\nAgree to the terms and then click on **Create App**.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-2.png?resize=1024%2C506&ssl=1)Figure 3 – Creating LinkedIn App\\n***Step 2***: Click **Verify** to verify your application.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-3.png?resize=1024%2C506&ssl=1)Figure 4 – Verify LinkedIn application\\n***Step 3***: Click **Generate URL** and copy the URL and click **I’m Done**.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-4-1.png?resize=1024%2C506&ssl=1)Figure 5 – Generate verification URL for the LinkedIn app\\n***Step 4***: Copy and hit the URL on the browser. It will ask you to verify the app for the page.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-5-1.png?resize=1024%2C506&ssl=1)Figure 6 – Verify LinkedIn app and Company association\\n***Step 5***: Click on **Verify**.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-6.png?resize=1024%2C506&ssl=1)Figure 7- LinkedIn app and Company association verified\\nGreat! You have now successfully created a LinkedIn company page and also created an app to interact with LinkedIn using the REST APIs.\\n\\n\\n# Configure your LinkedIn App\\n\\n\\nLet’s configure the LinkedIn app that we have created in the previous section. We will add the products required to access the LinkedIn REST APIs and store the app credentials.\\n\\n\\n## Add the products for your LinkedIn App.\\n\\n\\nOnce you have created the LinkedIn App, you need to define what are the products that you are going to use with your app. Based on this, your app will be provided with the necessary permissions that you need. There are three products available to choose from.\\n\\n\\n1. **Share on LinkedIn** – This allows you to post content from your profile.\\n2. **Sign In with LinkedIn** – This allows you to use LinkedIn social sign on your webpage.\\n3. **Marketing Developer Platform** – Allows you to post content from your page.\\n\\n\\nAs a part of this article, I am going to add all three products to my app.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-7.png?resize=1024%2C506&ssl=1)Figure 8 – Add products to LinkedIn app\\nThe **Marketing Developer Platform** requires additional access. You will receive a form for this. Fill up the form and wait for approval (2 business days). Click on the **View Access Form** and fill it up with relevant details.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-8.png?resize=1024%2C561&ssl=1)Figure 9 – Fill up review form for Marketing Developer Platform\\nOnce you submit the form, it might take up to 2 business days to get an answer by email. You will then notice the app has been added to your product list.\\n\\n\\n💡 The ***Marketing Developer Platform*** allows you to post content from your company page. Without adding it, you can still post content from your personal LinkedIn profile.\\n\\n\\n## Fetch and store the app credentials.\\n\\n\\n***Step 1***: On your LinkedIn app, click on the **Auth** tab. You can find the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that you need later.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-9.png?resize=1024%2C506&ssl=1)Figure 10 – Store LinkedIn app credentials\\n***Step 2***: Add the redirect URL for your App. This can simply be your webpage URL appended with “*/auth/linkedin/callback*”.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-10.png?resize=1024%2C561&ssl=1)Figure 11 – Setup app Redirect URI\\n***Step 3***: Get the **Organization ID** from the company URL.\\n\\n\\n![](https://i0.wp.com/datacloudmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-11.png?resize=912%2C68&ssl=1)Figure 12 – Get Organization ID\\n# Start assembling your Python code\\n\\n\\nNow let’s start building the python program that would allow us to interact with the LinkedIn REST APIs.\\n\\n\\n## Setup static variables and libraries\\n\\n\\nIn order to work with REST APIs in python, we will leverage the `requests` library. You can install it using the python `pip` manager. In addition to that, we will also create variables to store our `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `organization_id` that we have obtained in the previous section.\\n\\n\\n\\n.gist table { margin-bottom: 0; }\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

The Access Token can be obtained in two steps as follows.\\n\\n\\n1. A **GET** request that will ask the user to allow your app to obtain the required permissions and redirect you to a new URL. From this URL, you’ll need to extract the value in the parameter code.\\n2. A **POST** request that will return your brand new Access Token.\\n\\n\\n## Create the GET request to obtain verification code\\n\\n\\nSetup the following details to build the URL.\\n\\n\\n* `base_url`: The LinkedIn endpoint to obtain authorization code.\\n* `redirect_uri`: The redirect URL you have set while creating your app.\\n* `scope`: The scope required to publish content from your personal profile.\\n* `state`: A random text that will be returned to you after authorization. This allows you to verify the response from CSRF attacks.
